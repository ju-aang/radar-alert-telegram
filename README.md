# radar-alert-telegram
Weather modification requires the accuracy of atmospheric conditions in the operating area so that work can be carried out optimally, one important indicator is the availability of potential clouds that can be sown using radar.

Previously, monitoring activities were carried out manually on the BMKG (Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency) website which updates every 10 minutes. I'm currently building a telegram bot that can instantly notify you if there's a potential cloud.

This tool is very easy and shortens the working time required.
